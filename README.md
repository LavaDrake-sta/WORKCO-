🚀 Software Engineering Student · Building Real Systems, Not Exercises

Hi, I'm Adi Stamker, a Software Engineering student with a strong focus on systems programming, backend engineering, compilers, and real-time architectures.
My GitHub showcases production-style projects I've built throughout my studies — fully designed, implemented, documented, and written with engineering discipline.

🔧 Core Engineering Work
🖥 Operating Systems (C)

Implemented a fully functional Linux-like shell
Supports: pipes, redirection, background jobs, permissions, grep, chmod, nano, cat, cp, and more.

🧩 Compiler Construction (Java + Lex/Yacc)

Built a complete Scanner (Lex) + Parser (Yacc)

Designed a custom AST, semantic rules, tree builder, and error-handling logic.

☕ Advanced Java Systems

Multi-class architectures with OOP principles, interfaces, design patterns

Implemented multithreading, synchronization, event-driven logic, and system simulations.

🌐 Full-Stack & Backend Development

Django · React · ASP.NET MVC · SQL Server

API-driven systems, authentication flows, ORM work, and real application logic.

📡 IoT & Real-Time Data Engineering

End-to-end pipeline: Sensors → MQTT → Node-RED → QuestDB

Developed dashboards, automation flows, real-time simulations, and monitoring UI.

🔗 Cyber & Blockchain

Smart contracts in Solidity, blockchain architecture design, and secure flows.

🎨 Frontend Engineering (HTML/CSS/JS)

Built a complete web project from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Focus on responsive design, UI/UX principles, clean structure, and interactive components.

🎯 Engineering Philosophy

I focus on:

Writing clean, modular, and maintainable code

Understanding system internals, not just using frameworks

Designing architectures with clarity and purpose

Building projects that reflect real engineering, not classroom exercises

Browse my repositories and you’ll find detailed documentation, thoughtful design, and real implementations of complex concepts.
